# Beginner-mySQL-Tutorial
This repository contains all the code examples from a youtube tutorial I completed called "MySQL Basics Tutorial Series" by Alex the Analyst
This tutorial went through some of the basic mySQL commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIKE, HAVING, ORDER BY, and the process of aliasing data
This was my first exposure to manipulating any sort of database in mySQL workbench
